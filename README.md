# Breast Cancer Classification
Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly diseases, so early detection is essential to increase the chances of cure. The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset is often used for research in detecting malignant and benign tumors using classification methods. 

This analysis was conducted using Python and various libraries such as pandas for reading and processing data, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. The Machine Learning model used was the Random Forest Classifier from sklearn.ensemble, which was trained with data that had been split using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection. Model evaluation is done with accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, and ROC Curve & AUC Score to measure the model's performance in distinguishing cancer classes.

With this approach, the model is able to perform cancer classification with high accuracy, which can be useful in assisting cancer diagnosis more objectively and efficiently.
